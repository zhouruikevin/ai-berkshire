# AI Berkshire — Value Investing Research Framework for the AI Era

> "Price is what you pay, value is what you get." — Warren Buffett
>
> Redefining the depth and efficiency of investment research with AI.

**AI Berkshire** is a collection of investment research skills built for **Qoder** as the primary environment, and also compatible with Claude Code and Codex. It systematizes the methodologies of four value investing masters — Buffett, Munger, Duan Yongping, and Li Lu — and delivers professional-grade research through AI Agents.

One person + Claude Code / Codex = an entire investment research team.

## Why Can't You Just Ask AI Directly?

You can, of course, ask Claude: "Should I buy Pinduoduo?" You'll get a balanced "on one hand... on the other hand..." analysis that ends with "investing involves risks, please make your own judgment."

**That kind of analysis looks right but can't drive actual decisions.**

AI Berkshire doesn't solve the "can AI analyze?" problem — it solves the **analysis quality and decision discipline** problem. Here's what's different:

### 1. Forces a Verdict — No Fence-Sitting

Ask AI directly, and you get a both-sides-pleasing "analysis." AI Berkshire forces concrete output: **Pass / Fail / Gray Zone**, with specific price ranges and tiered recommendations.

> Vanilla AI response: *"Pinduoduo has growth potential but also faces competitive pressure. Investors should weigh..."*
>
> AI Berkshire output:

> | Strategy | Recommendation | Price Range |
> |----------|---------------|-------------|
> | Aggressive | Build 20% position at current price | $95–105 |
> | Moderate | Wait for buyback policy clarity | $85–95 |
> | Conservative | Doesn't meet 10-year certainty bar — pass | — |
>
> **Mirror Test**: If you can't articulate it in 5 sentences = don't buy. No exceptions.

### 2. Four-Master Dialectic, Not a Single Perspective

It's not just "analyze this using Buffett's method." The four perspectives create **real tension and contradictions** —

Take Pinduoduo as an example:
- **Duan Yongping** (business model): Great business, C2M model hard to replicate → 3.7/5
- **Buffett** (financial valuation): Ex-cash P/E just 6.3x, a cash machine → 4.4/5
- **Munger** (inversion): Moat shallower than it appears — Douyin hit ¥4 trillion GMV in 3 years → 3.5/5
- **Li Lu** (long-term certainty): Management culture concerns, uncertain in 10 years → 2.0/5

**Buffett says "genuinely cheap," Li Lu says "if uncertain, don't buy"** — this conflict is the real state of investment decisions. A single prompt can't produce this multi-perspective dialectic, yet it's precisely what prevents blind spots.

### 3. Structured Anti-Bias Mechanisms

AI's greatest danger isn't giving wrong answers — it's giving answers that **look right but don't withstand scrutiny**. AI Berkshire embeds multiple "anti-deception" layers into the process:

| Mechanism | Problem Solved | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Information Richness Rating (A/B/C)** | Prevents "more data = more certainty" illusion | Pop Mart rated B: limited data, estimated metrics flagged with confidence levels |
| **Munger-Style Inversion Test** | Forces thinking about failure scenarios | "How could Pinduoduo die?" → Lists 5 scenarios with probabilities |
| **Quick-Kill Checklist** | 8 red lines, any one is a veto | Management integrity issues → immediate rejection regardless of valuation |
| **Contrarian Check** | Avoids thinking like the crowd | "Why are smart people shorting this?" → Surfaces overlooked risks |
| **Intellectual Honesty** | Prefer "I don't know" | Marks data gaps as "gray zone" rather than filling certainty with speculation |

### 4. Financial Data Precision

LLMs can't do mental math reliably. Getting a P/E wrong by one decimal point or confusing HKD with CNY can lead to catastrophic investment decisions.

**Real case**: When analyzing Tencent, different sources reported market cap in "HKD billions" and "CNY billions." AI Berkshire's approach:

```bash
# Market cap manual verification: Price × Shares Outstanding, cross-checked with reported data
python3 tools/financial_rigor.py verify-market-cap \
  --price 510 --shares 9.11e9 --reported 4.65e12 --currency HKD
# ✅ Verified — deviation only 0.08%
```

All calculations use Python `decimal.Decimal` (exact decimal arithmetic), not `float`. Key data requires at least 2 independent sources for cross-validation.

### 5. Reproducible Research Process

Ask AI directly, and the format, depth, and coverage vary every time — today's Tencent analysis has a moat score, tomorrow's Meituan analysis might forget it.

AI Berkshire ensures: **Same input → structurally consistent, equally deep output.** This means you can:
- Compare 7 companies side by side with identical scoring criteria
- Re-analyze the same company 6 months later and directly compare changes
- Align research outputs across team members

> Real output — 7 companies screened with the same Checklist:
>
> | Company | Verdict | Circle of Competence | Good Business | Moat | Management | Margin of Safety | Overall |
> |---------|:-------:|:-------------------:|:------------:|:----:|:----------:|:---------------:|:-------:|
> | Kweichow Moutai | ✅ Pass | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★☆ | 4.7 |
> | Tencent | ✅ Pass | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★☆ | 4.7 |
> | NVIDIA | ✅ Conditional | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★☆☆ | 4.3 |
> | Meituan | ✅ Conditional | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★☆ | 4.0 |
> | Kuaishou | ✅ Conditional | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★★ | 4.0 |
> | Pinduoduo | ❓ Gray | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★☆ | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★★ | 3.8 |
> | Pop Mart | ❓ Gray | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★★ | ★★★☆☆ | 3.7 |

### 6. Multi-Agent Parallelism = Multiplied Research Depth

`/investment-team` launches 4 independent Agents to research a company **simultaneously**. Each Agent conducts its own web searches, cross-validates data, and reaches independent conclusions. This isn't splitting one prompt into four sections — it's 4 "analysts" each doing complete research, with a Team Lead synthesizing the final call.

Ask AI directly, and you have one context window. Four parallel Agents means 4× the search volume, 4× the information sources, and 4 independent perspectives.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   Team Lead (You)                        │
│            Coordinate · Synthesize · Decide              │
├──────────┬──────────┬──────────────┬───────────────┤
│ Agent 1        │ Agent 2        │ Agent 3              │ Agent 4               │
│ Business Model │ Financials     │ Industry &           │ Risk &                │
│ Duan Yongping  │ Buffett        │ Competition          │ Management            │
│                │                │ Munger               │ Li Lu                 │
└──────────┴──────────┴──────────────┴───────────────┘
         ↓ Parallel research, real-time progress ↓
                  Final Synthesized Report
```

### In One Sentence

> **Regular users asking AI get "analysis that looks right." With AI Berkshire, you get "research reports you can actually make decisions from."**

## Quick Start

> **Qoder is recommended.** This repo ships `.qoder/` (rules + 18 project-level skills), so opening the repo in Qoder auto-loads everything with zero setup. Claude Code / Codex are supported as compatibility entry points.

### 1. Install an AI Client

This repository keeps one canonical workflow and provides Qoder skills, Claude Code commands, and Codex skills. Install the client you plan to use.

For Qoder users (recommended):

Download and install Qoder IDE from [qoder.com](https://qoder.com), then open this repository with it — `.qoder/skills` load automatically as project-level skills and `.qoder/rules` are injected as research guidelines.

For Claude Code users:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

For Codex users:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh | sh

# Or use npm
npm install -g @openai/codex

# Or use Homebrew
brew install --cask codex

# Verify installation
codex --version
```

Windows users can use the official PowerShell installer: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.ps1 | iex"`.

If `codex --version` prints a version, you can continue with this project's Codex skills installation.

#### Reducing Approval Prompts

These skills issue many tool calls, and Claude Code asks for approval for each one by default. That behavior comes from Claude Code's client-side permission system; it is not a repository default this project can change.

If you trust the current workflow and are running in a trusted environment, start Claude Code in skip-permissions mode:

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

Warning: this disables Claude Code's tool-approval guardrails. Use it only when you trust the repository, commands, and working directory.

### 2. Install Skills

For Qoder users (recommended):

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/xbtlin/ai-berkshire.git

# Just open the directory in Qoder — project-level skills load automatically, no install needed.
# To use them across all projects, install to the user-level ~/.qoder/skills:
cd ai-berkshire
./scripts/install-qoder-skills.sh
```

For Claude Code users:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/xbtlin/ai-berkshire.git

# Copy skills to Claude Code global commands directory
cd ai-berkshire
./scripts/install-claude-commands.sh
```

For Codex users:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/xbtlin/ai-berkshire.git

# Generate and install Codex skills to ~/.codex/skills
cd ai-berkshire
./scripts/install-codex-skills.sh

# Optional: install Codex slash prompts to ~/.codex/prompts
# for a Claude Code-like /investment-research entry point
./scripts/install-codex-prompts.sh
```

The repository treats `skills/*.md` as the **single canonical source**; every other entry point is generated from it: `.qoder/skills/*/SKILL.md` are Qoder project-level skills generated by `scripts/sync-qoder-skills.py`; `codex-skills/*/SKILL.md` are Codex skill packages generated by `scripts/sync-codex-skills.py`; `codex-prompts/*.md` are an optional Codex slash-prompt compatibility layer. After editing `skills/*.md`, run these three sync scripts to keep all platforms in sync.

### 3. Use

In Qoder, type `/` to see all 18 skills and pick one, or describe your task in natural language — Qoder auto-matches the right skill by its description. Slash invocation matches the Claude Code examples below (e.g. `/investment-research Tencent`).

Invoke directly in Claude Code:

```bash
# Deep Research
/investment-research Tencent
/investment-team Meituan
/management-deep-dive Wang Xing, Meituan
/private-company-research SpaceX
/deep-company-series Pinduoduo

# Earnings Analysis
/earnings-review Tencent 2025Q4
/earnings-team PDD 2025 Annual

# Industry Screening
/industry-research Nuclear Power
/industry-funnel AI Compute
/quality-screen Hang Seng Index Constituents
/bottleneck-hunter AI Infrastructure
/investment-checklist Moutai, NVIDIA, Apple

# Portfolio Management
/portfolio-review Tencent 30%, Meituan 20%, Moutai 20%, Cash 30%
/thesis-tracker Pinduoduo
/news-pulse Tencent

# Thinking Tools
/dyp-ask Where is Pinduoduo's real moat?
/wechat-article Meituan
```

After installing for Codex, restart Codex and refer to skills by name, for example:

```text
Use investment-research to research Tencent
Use earnings-review to analyze PDD 2025 annual results
Use industry-funnel to screen AI compute
Use bottleneck-hunter to scan AI infrastructure bottlenecks
Use wechat-article to write a Meituan investment article
```

If you install Codex slash prompts, restart Codex and search for them in the `/` menu. Codex's official custom prompt entry point usually appears as `prompts:<name>`, for example:

```text
/prompts:investment-research Tencent
```

## Detailed Skill Descriptions

### 1. `/investment-research` — Four-Master Comprehensive Analysis

The most thorough single-company deep research framework. Executes seven modules in sequence:

```
Data Collection → Business Essence (Duan Yongping) → Moat (Buffett) → Inversion (Munger)
    → Management Assessment (Duan Yongping + Buffett) → Civilizational Trends (Li Lu)
    → Valuation & Margin of Safety
```

**Key Features**:
- AI research bias awareness mechanism (A/B/C information richness rating)
- Multi-source cross-validation on key data (manual market cap calculation, 2+ independent sources)
- Each master's "follow-up questions" woven throughout
- Three-scenario valuation (bull/base/bear) + reverse DCF

**Sample Output Excerpt**:

> #### Comprehensive Decision Memo
>
> | Dimension | Conclusion | Confidence |
> |-----------|-----------|------------|
> | Business Quality (Duan Yongping) | Excellent: platform business, two-sided network effects, near-zero marginal cost | ★★★★★ |
> | Moat (Buffett) | Wide and widening: network effects + switching costs + scale economies, triple-layered | ★★★★☆ |
> | Management (Duan Yongping + Buffett) | Strong: founder-led, excellent capital allocation discipline | ★★★★☆ |
> | Top Risk (Munger) | Regulatory policy uncertainty; new business losses dragging overall profits | ★★★☆☆ |
> | Civilizational Trend (Li Lu) | Aligned with digital consumption trends, but not a "civilization-level paradigm shift" | ★★★★☆ |
> | Valuation (Buffett + Duan Yongping) | Current P/E 18x, slightly below historical median, modest margin of safety | ★★★★☆ |
>
> **Duan Yongping**: "The essence of this business is connecting consumers and merchants — profiting from efficiency gains. The hallmark of a great business: more users bring more merchants, more merchants bring more users. Once the flywheel spins, it's very hard to stop."
>
> **Munger**: "Invert, always invert — if this company vanished tomorrow, what would users and merchants do? If the answer is 'quickly find a substitute,' the moat isn't deep enough. If the answer is 'life would become very inconvenient,' that's worth paying attention to."

---

### 2. `/investment-team` — Multi-Agent Research Team

Launches 4 AI Agents in parallel, simulating a real investment research team. Each Agent searches independently, analyzes independently, and delivers independent ratings. The Team Lead synthesizes the final judgment.

**Sample Output Excerpt**:

> #### One-Line Conclusion
> Meituan is the undisputed leader in China's local life services, with multi-layered network effect moats. Current valuation sits at historically low levels — significant long-term value. Recommend accumulating on dips.
>
> #### Four-Dimension Scorecard
>
> | Dimension | Framework | Score | Core Judgment |
> |-----------|-----------|-------|---------------|
> | Business Model & Moat | Duan Yongping | ★★★★☆ | Strong two-sided network effects; food delivery + in-store form a flywheel |
> | Financials & Valuation | Buffett | ★★★★☆ | Core business margins improving steadily; valuation at historical lows |
> | Industry & Competition | Munger | ★★★☆☆ | Douyin invading in-store business; competitive landscape may deteriorate |
> | Risk & Management | Li Lu | ★★★★☆ | Wang Xing has exceptional strategic vision, but new business cash burn needs monitoring |
>
> **Composite Score: 3.8 / 5**
>
> #### Investment Recommendation
>
> | Strategy | Recommendation | Price Range (HKD) |
> |----------|---------------|-------------------|
> | Aggressive | Build 30% position at current price | 120–140 |
> | Moderate | Wait for pullback to 100–110 to enter | 100–120 |
> | Conservative | Wait for quarterly results to confirm margin trend | <100 |

---

### 3. `/investment-checklist` — Buffett Pre-Buy Checklist

Six gates for rapid screening — decide in 10 minutes whether a company is worth deeper research:

```
Gate 1: Circle of Competence (Can I understand it?)
    ↓ Pass
Gate 2: Good Business (What are the economics?)
    ↓ Pass
Gate 3: Moat (How deep is the competitive advantage?)
    ↓ Pass
Gate 4: Management (Can they be trusted?)
    ↓ Pass
Gate 5: Margin of Safety (Is the price cheap enough?)
    ↓ Pass
Gate 6: Decision Discipline (Rational or FOMO?)
    ↓ Pass
   ✅ Mirror Test
```

**Supports multi-company comparison** — screen multiple targets at once:

```
/investment-checklist Tencent, Alibaba, Meituan, Pinduoduo
```

**Sample Output Excerpt**:

> #### Mirror Test
>
> "I am buying Tencent at HK$380 because:
> 1. The essence of this business is a **social network + digital content platform** — I understand it;
> 2. Its moat is **1.2 billion users' social graph**, and it's widening;
> 3. Management — **Pony Ma is understated, pragmatic, and an excellent capital allocator** — trustworthy;
> 4. The current price represents **~80% of intrinsic value**, providing a meaningful margin of safety;
> 5. Even if I'm wrong, downside is manageable because **net cash exceeds ¥200 billion and gaming cash flow is rock-solid**."
>
> ✅ Passed the Mirror Test
>
> **If you can't articulate it in 5 sentences = don't buy. No exceptions.**

---

### 4. `/industry-research` — Industry Value Chain Scan

Start from an investment theme and complete a full industry value chain study:

```
Investment Logic Chain → Value Chain Map → Global Listed Company Scan
    → Four-Master Analysis on Segment Leaders → Portfolio Allocation Recommendation
```

**Sample Output Excerpt**:

> #### Investment Logic Chain: Nuclear Power
>
> Underlying Trend: AI data center power demand explosion + carbon neutrality goals
> → Drives: surging demand for stable, clean baseload power
> → Creates: deterministic demand for nuclear restarts / new builds / SMRs
> → Benefits: uranium mining → fuel fabrication → equipment manufacturing → operators
>
> #### Recommended Portfolio
>
> | Tier | Weight | Target | Segment | Core Logic |
> |------|--------|--------|---------|------------|
> | Core | 50% | CGN / Cameco | Operations + Uranium | Highest certainty |
> | Satellite | 30% | CNNP / Dongfang Electric | Operations + Equipment | Domestic substitution beneficiary |
> | Option | 15% | NuScale / Nano Nuclear | SMR | High risk, high convexity |
> | ETF | Alternative | URA / URNM | Full chain | Passive approach |

---

### 5. `/industry-funnel` — Industry Funnel Screening

Start from an industry/theme and progressively narrow: **Full market → ≤10 → 3 deep dives**:

```
Full Market Scan (activity + returns + top-30 market cap union → 30-60 companies)
    ↓ 5 value investing hard filters
Rough Cut ≤ 10
    ↓ Detailed analysis (300-500 words each)
Detailed Analysis ≤ 10
    ↓ Final selection (by portfolio complementarity, NOT by top-3 score)
Four-Master Deep Analysis on 3 companies (800-1200 words each)
    ↓
Recommended Portfolio (Core / Satellite / Option) + Action Signals
```

**Key Features**:
- Every layer has explicit keep/drop criteria — eliminated names come with a stated reason (not a black box)
- Final 3 are selected for **portfolio complementarity** (high certainty + moderate upside + high convexity), not by ranking scores
- Mandatory "future IPO candidates" list to avoid missing private-market key players
- AI bias awareness: counters large-cap bias / English-language bias / narrative bias / listed-only bias

**Difference from `/industry-research`**:
- `industry-research` emphasizes value chain structure and panoramic view (sliced by segment)
- `industry-funnel` emphasizes the stock-picking funnel (progressive screening from full market to 3)

**Live Test: AI Sector, 4 Sub-Tracks in Parallel (2026-05-09)**:

| Sub-Track | Final 3 | Core Position Pick |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| AI Compute | TSMC / NVIDIA / SK Hynix | TSMC ★★★★★ |
| AI Models | Alphabet / Meta / Alibaba | Alphabet ★★★★★ |
| AI Applications | Microsoft / Adobe / AppLovin | Microsoft + Adobe ★★★★ |
| AI Infrastructure & Power | Eaton / TBEA / Talen Energy | Eaton + TBEA ★★★★ |

**Key Insight**: The biggest winners in the AI application layer aren't AI-native companies — they're established giants with distribution, data, and workflow embeddedness. This echoes the 1995–2000 Internet bubble's "sell the picks and shovels" pattern (Amazon and Apple won; Pets.com didn't).

### 6. `/private-company-research` — Private Company Deep Research

A "detective-style" research framework designed for information-scarce private companies:

**Key Differentiators**:
- **Financial data piecing**: Assembled from IPO filings, parent company reports, funding news, and industry data
- **Confidence tagging**: Every data point tagged 🟢 High / 🟡 Medium / 🔴 Low confidence
- **Multi-method valuation cross-check**: Funding-round valuation + comparable companies + DCF + endgame backsolve
- **Exit path analysis**: Full evaluation of IPO / M&A / secondary transfer paths

**Sample Output Excerpt**:

> #### Company Snapshot: SpaceX
>
> | Item | Detail |
> |------|--------|
> | Latest Valuation | ~$350B (2025 secondary market) 🟡 |
> | Estimated Revenue | ~$13B (2024) 🟡 |
> | Starlink Subscribers | 4M+ (end of 2024) 🟢 |
> | Launch Cadence | 100+ per year (2024) 🟢 |
>
> #### Valuation Assessment
>
> | Method | Valuation Range | Notes |
> |--------|----------------|-------|
> | Latest Funding | $350B | Secondary market price; includes liquidity premium |
> | Comparable Companies | $200–280B | Benchmarked against telecom + aerospace + defense |
> | DCF (Base Case) | $250–350B | Assumes Starlink $30B revenue by 2027 |
> | Endgame Backsolve | $400–600B | Assumes Starlink becomes global telecom infrastructure |
>
> **Composite Fair Value Range: $250B – $400B**

---

### 7. `/news-pulse` — Price-Move Rapid Attribution

Designed for "when a stock surges or drops, quickly figure out what happened." **Not deep research — it's 10–15 minute rapid attribution** to avoid panic-selling or essay-length anxiety spirals when your holdings move.

**Key Differentiators**:
- **4-dimensional parallel recon**: Company events / Regulatory policy / Industry competitors / Market sentiment (sell-side + influencers + southbound capital flows)
- **Attribution over listing**: Doesn't just list all news — judges "which event actually explains this price move"
- **Mandatory nature classification**: Value Event / Sentiment Fluctuation / **True Cause Unknown** / Mixed — where "True Cause Unknown" is often the most valuable output (potential insider front-running)
- **Clear action items**: Whether to trigger deep research, re-examine your thesis, or simply watch

**When to Use What**:
| Scenario | Skill |
|----------|-------|
| Complete research (hours) | `/investment-team` or `/investment-research` |
| Earnings deep read | `/earnings-review` |

**Sample Output Excerpt** (Tencent 4/17–5/01 live test, -10.47% over 14 days):

> #### One-Line Attribution
> Approximately 70–80% of this -10.47% drop was driven by fund flows and sentiment (buyback blackout period + southbound selling + sector beta + AI narrative displacement). 20–30% came from deferred digestion of the AI capex doubling announcement — **no fundamental deterioration**. Sell-side consensus remains Buy. This is a "liquidity + sentiment-driven pullback," not a value event.

## Design Philosophy

### Four-Master Methodology Synthesis

```
              ┌──────────────────┐
              │   Duan Yongping   │
              │  "The Right Biz"  │
              │  Business Essence │
              └────────┬─────────┘
                       │
    ┌──────────────────┼──────────────────┐
    │                  │                  │
    ▼                  ▼                  ▼
┌────────┐     ┌──────────┐      ┌────────┐
│ Buffett │     │  Munger   │      │ Li Lu  │
│  Moat   │     │ Inversion │      │ Civ.   │
│ Margin  │     │ Risk List │      │ Trends │

│ Safety  │     │  Audit    │      │ Shift  │
└────────┘     └──────────┘      └────────┘
```

The four masters aren't just dividing labor — they're designed to **challenge each other**:
- Duan Yongping says "great business" → Munger asks "how could it die?"
- Buffett says "cheap enough" → Li Lu asks "will it still exist in 10 years?"
- What you get isn't four reports stitched together — it's four thinking systems colliding

### Financial Rigor Tool (`tools/financial_rigor.py`)

| Feature | Command | Problem Solved |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| **Market Cap Verification** | `verify-market-cap` | Price × shares outstanding, exact calculation, detects unit errors |
| **Valuation Verification** | `verify-valuation` | P/E / P/B / ROE / FCF Yield — exact decimal arithmetic |
| **Multi-Source Cross-Validation** | `cross-validate` | Auto-compare same data point across N sources; alerts above tolerance |
| **Three-Scenario Valuation** | `three-scenario` | Bull / base / bear exact target price calculation |
| **Benford's Law Detection** | `benford` | Detect anomalies in first-digit distribution of financial data |
| **Precision Calculator** | `calc` | Any financial expression computed exactly — replaces LLM mental math |

**Design Principle**: All calculations use Python `decimal.Decimal` (exact decimal), not `float` (floating-point approximation). `0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3` must never fail in a financial context.
